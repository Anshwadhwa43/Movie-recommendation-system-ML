🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Machine Learning Project)

This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning techniques. It suggests movies to users based on their past ratings and similarities with other users/items.

The system is implemented in Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates both Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering approaches.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing & exploratory analysis of movie ratings dataset

User-based & Item-based Collaborative Filtering

Content-based recommendations using cosine similarity

Model evaluation using RMSE and accuracy metrics

Jupyter Notebook implementation with clean step-by-step workflow

📊 Dataset

Source: MovieLens Dataset

Contains millions of movie ratings from real users

Includes movie metadata (genres, titles, release year)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy → data wrangling

Scikit-learn → ML algorithms & evaluation

Surprise Library → collaborative filtering models

Matplotlib, Seaborn → visualization

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Results

Generated Top 10 movie recommendations for sample users

Collaborative Filtering achieved RMSE ~0.87 on test set

Visualized rating distributions, popular movies, and similarity scores

🎯 Future Improvements

Deploy a Streamlit/Flask app for interactive recommendations

Integrate deep learning (Autoencoders, Neural CF)

Add real-time recommendation pipeline with APIs
